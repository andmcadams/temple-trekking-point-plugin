# Temple Trekking Points Plugin
A simple plugin that displays the current and last Temple Trekking point count.
This plugin is intended to be used to determine the relationship between points earned and number of rewards earned.

Points can be seen via varbit 1955.
Path difficulty determines points per action while follower difficulty increases potential actions per event.
